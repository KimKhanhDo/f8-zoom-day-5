                    The story of Melbourne coffee walks alongside the history of
                    the city. In the 1830s the temperance movement needed to
                    attract patrons away from the pubs. Ornate ‘coffee palaces’
                    offered the hotel experience, sans alcohol. Today’s Hotel
                    Windsor served as the 400-room Grand Coffee Palace between
                    1886 and 1897. On the streets outside, coffee stalls began
                    servicing the city’s on-the-move workers.

                    But our real caffeine kick came with the immigration boom of
                    World War II. Craving a taste of home, Italians brought
                    espresso coffee, and with it, a cafe culture of cosmopolitan
                    cool.

                    Travelling Melburnians know the pain of not finding good
                    coffee in the US, but if they walked into expat-owned
                    Bluestone Lane or Little Collins in Manhattan, they’d
                    encounter excellent coffee and sharp decor similar to a
                    Melbourne cafe – and that’s to say nothing of the fact they
                    know how to make a flat white. It goes beyond a morning
                    cuppa.

                    ST ALi, a big name in Melbourne coffee, now applies its
                    meticulous sourcing and roasting to ready-to-drink products
                    like its cold-brew cans. For those who expect cafe quality
                    all the time, says managing director Lachlan Ward, it’s
                    about “how these products can fit in with the rest of your
                    life – because you don’t spend your whole life in a cafe.”
                    But don’t worry; Melbourne cafes aren’t going anywhere. “You
                    can’t replace going to a cafe and having a chat with a mate,
                    or the fact your local barista knows your name and your
                    order,” says Ward.

                            Interesting how the coffee scene feels like part of
                            the city's identity.
